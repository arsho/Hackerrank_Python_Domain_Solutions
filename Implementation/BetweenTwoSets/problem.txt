There will be two arrays of integers. Determine all integers that satisfy the following two conditions:

1. The elements of the first array are all factors of the integer being considered
2. The integer being considered is a factor of all elements of the second array
These numbers are referred to as being between the two arrays. Determine how many such numbers exist.

for example:
    a = [2, 4]
    b = [16, 32, 96]
in the above lists, list a has 2 and 4, list b has 16, 32, 96. now find out all the numbers that are same as the multiple of both elements in a and at the same time factors of every element in b. 
For more understanding take a look at the demonstration below:

Multiples of 2 of a = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, ...... all the way upto 100 (1 <= a[i] <= 100)
Multiples of 4 of a = 4, 8, 12, 16, 20........  all the way upto 100 (1 <= a[i] <= 100)

Factors of 16 of b = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16
Factors of 32 of b = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32
Factors of 96 of b = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 96

so from the above lines we see that only 4, 8, and 16 are shared in every line. hence the result is 
len([4, 8, 16]) = 3
